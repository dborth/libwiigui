## libwiigui 1.06
https://github.com/dborth/libwiigui (Under GPL License)

libwiigui is a GUI library for the Wii, created to help structure the
design of a complicated GUI interface, and to enable an author to create
a sophisticated, feature-rich GUI. It was originally conceived and written
after I started to design a GUI for Snes9x GX, and found libwiisprite and
GRRLIB inadequate for the purpose. It uses GX for drawing, and makes use
of PNGU for displaying images and FreeTypeGX for text. It was designed to
be flexible and is easy to modify - don't be afraid to change the way it
works or expand it to suit your GUI's purposes! If you do, and you think
your changes might benefit others, please share them so they might be
added to the project!


### Quickstart

Start from the supplied template example. For more advanced uses, see the
source code for Snes9x GX, FCE Ultra GX, and Visual Boy Advance GX.

### Credits

This library was wholly designed and written by Tantric. Thanks to the
authors of PNGU and FreeTypeGX, of which this library makes use. Thanks
also to the authors of GRRLIB and libwiisprite for laying the foundations.
Thanks to mvit for the artwork and Peter de Man for the music used in the
template.
